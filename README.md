## Precipitation Analysis

- Find the most recent date in the dataset.
- Using that date, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.
- Select only the "date" and "prcp" values.
- Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame, and set the index to the "date" column.
- Sort the DataFrame values by "date".
- Plot the results by using the DataFrame plot method.
- Use Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

## Station Analysis

- Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.
- Design a query to find the most-active stations.
- Design a query that calculates the lowest, highest, and average temperatures that filters on the most-active station id found in the previous query.
